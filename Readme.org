#+TITLE: VS Modeline

* Overview

VS Modeline is a somehow minimalist modeline for Emacs.

The design goals are to be minimally obtrusive, reasonably efficient and easy to customize.

* Installation

The package is not available on ELPA nor MELPA, so your best bet is using a package manager that can manage remote Git repositories, such as [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]].

This snippet is taken from my configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package vs-modeline
  :straight (vs-modeline :type git
                         :host github
                         :repo "VojtechStep/vs-modeline.el")
  :demand t
  :config
  (vs-modeline-mode))
#+end_src

* Documentation

The modeline integrates with evil, projectile, flycheck, org-mode, pdf-tools, and built-in Emacs functionality. For a list of available segments, search for calls to =vs-modeline-def-segment= and =vs-modeline-def-prop-segment= in [[file:vs-modeline.el]].

The modeline is split into left and right parts, which are controlled by the =vs-modeline-left= and =vs-modeline-right= variables, respectively.

Two helpers are provided for defining new segments.
The =vs-modeline-def-prop-segment= accepts at minimum the name of the segment, the text to show, and the face to show it in.
The =vs-modeline-def-segment= is more lower level, and only accepts the name of the segment and the form to be evaluated.
See their respective documentations and usage.

* Dependencies
There are no hard dependencies for running the modeline other than Emacs. Additional packages may be required for their respective segments.

The frame switching depends on features introduced in Emacs 27.1. The only version the modeline is usually tested on is a some recent checkout of the native-comp branch of Emacs.
